# Motion planning: Dubins and Reeds-Sheep paths

Presentation done in the case of the course about Robotics.

Reeds-Sheep paper: https://web.archive.org/web/20111114143424/http://stat.wharton.upenn.edu/~shepp/publications/99.pdf

A try of implementation was done in CodeTry but with lack of time and the trivial in theory, rotation of an image which I didn't achieve to do cleanly in PyQt, I abandoned.

With an implementation using a RRT for instance to be able to add obstacles it becomes very interesting however it would require to write a bunch of code while I already understand how the whole would work so I prefer to focus on other projects where it's unclear how to make it work at a macro-scale.

Note: Again having my notes in English would have be better
